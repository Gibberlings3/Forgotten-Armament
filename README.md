## Introduction

This mod seeks to add items that:

There are a lot of enemies with normal/no weapons when they are at a level of the player who is wielding vastly better equipment.

Covers gaps in items.

## Compatibility
If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this mod, I recommend uninstalling all mod components and replacing all files with the new ones before doing a fresh install.

## Special Thanks

- Auve for early support in the creation of this mod.
