# Forgotten-Armament Item Descriptions

## Melee Weapons

### Battle Axes

#### Axe of Dead Illusk +2 (NWN2)

A little-known section of ruined Illusk holds corpse after corpse from a barbarian invasion repelled ages ago. The clan is forgotten, but their surviving weapons seem to embody everything cruel and savage in warfare, and create fearful images in the minds of those who witness them.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Each hit drains 1 Hit Point from the target and transfer it to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

Proficiency Type: Axe
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 10 Strength

Weight: 5

#### Battle Axe +2: Defender (IWD)

Besides its superb craftsmanship, tiny runes of power can be seen etched all along the surface. It's obvious a lot of time and effort went into its creation, and although not apparent at first, a slight blue glow can be seen emanating from the runes.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Armor Class: +2
- Missile Resistance: +10%

THAC0: +2

#### Deepstone Progeny +2 (NWN2)

Torgin of the Light was a respected and prolific slayer of undead, which made his eventual descent into vampirism all the more tragic. His still-living companions saw the change as an insult to the life he once cherished, and vowed to destroy his undead form. To this end they crafted the Deepstone Progeny, adapted from the weapon that had previously served Torgin so well. History does not record the outcome of the battle between Torgin and his friends, but their axes are found across Faerun.

STATISTICS:

 10 Strength

### Bastard Swords

#### Bloodletter +4 (NWN2) Non-Good ONLY

Forged in smoldering brimstone fires and cooled in the blood of its creator, a Bloodletter blade is a typically evil weapon, the kind of sword that has inspired more than a little diabolical laughter while being waved in the face of one or another virtuous knight. It is possessed of thoroughly heinous life-stealing energies, but if the fates of its previous owners are any indication, its major characteristic could well be the attraction of "comeuppance."

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Inflicts 2 points of bleeding damage per hit (one point per round)
- Each hit drains 1 Hit Point from the target and transfers it to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

Speed Factor: 5
Proficiency Type: Bastard Sword
Type: One-handed
Requires:
 11 Strength

Weight: 5

#### Discord +2 (NWN2)

A line of black crystal runs the length of this blade, marking it the handiwork of Ortius of Gond, the Mad Tinker. Blades from his stock resonate unnaturally when struck, and although mortal ears can barely perceive the tone, they certainly suffer the effects well enough. The origin of the crystal is not clear, though Ortius was known to have bartered his services to planar creatures on occasion.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- 20% chance per hit of confusing the target for 1 round (Save vs. Spell negates)

#### Flaming Bastard Sword +1 (IWD)

Besides its superb craftsmanship, tiny runes of power can be seen etched all along the surface. It's obvious a lot of time and effort went into its creation, and although not apparent at first, a slight blue glow can be seen emanating from the runes.

#### Nameless Light +2 (NWN2)

Legend states that the warrior Alesia brought the Nameless Light from the stars, although other tales claim it was forged by a grieving father, or was the weapon of a virtuous paladin. In truth, several such blades exist. They were created with the blessing of the Harpers, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Armor Class: +1
- Magic Resistance: +5%

THAC0: +2

Damage type: Slashing
Speed Factor: 6

### Daggers

#### Ice Talon +2 (NWN2)

Weapons of this type are technically impossible, since their blades are made of nothing but razor-sharp ice crystals. Most sages agree they are kept frozen by some sort of link to the inner planes, but this is ultimately just speculation. Ice Talon daggers show a jagged blade and may have been part of a single larger weapon at one time, though the force required to shatter the magic blade must have been enormous indeed.

STATISTICS:

 3 Strength

#### Myr Styah'be'eh +4 (NWN2)

Scholars have long argued over the nature of this blade, claming it as a part of many ancient empires - Mulhorandi, Netherese, Imaskari - but its construction defies the conventions of any known civilization. One young wizard, promptly laughed into obscurity, once put forth an argument that the item was actually of kobold make, that its name - considered untranslatable by all others who had studied it - meant something like "master stabby" in an obscure dialect of that dimunitive people. The scholar's final argument was that as harmless as many consider kobold to be today, they do claim their lineage from dragons - and if this blade is any proof, a weapon does not have to look magnificent to be viciously effective.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Critical Hit Chance: +5%

### Flails

#### Crooked Flail +1 (IWD)

The flail is a sturdy wooden handle attached to an iron rod, a wooden rod with spikes, or a spiked iron ball. Between the handle and its implement is either a hinge or chain link. The weapon was originally used as a tool for threshing grain.

### Halberds

#### Cruel Halberd +3

This halberd, permanently stained with the blood of its victims, was wielded by several generations of orc warlords, all who either took it up when the previous owner died in battle or was murdered by a rival. The halberd was lost in the final battle when the orcs were finally driven out of Illusk.

#### Kaga-To +1 (NWN2)

If memory serves correctly, these weapons date to the stadium battles of old Kai Chen province, where promising warriors would test their skills against the greatest samurai of the day in ritual combat. If ever a challenger was victorious, he or she won the people's ovation and fame forever, symbolized by a Kaga-To katana. The blade is etched with a simple phrase: "Tell me how you fight, and I will tell you what you are."

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:

#### Master Li's Way +2 (NWN2)

Once thought a unique instance of the swordmaker's craft, several katanas of this type have now been linked to a ship that ran aground on the Sword Coast some years ago. All bear the markings of Master Hu Li, a great artificer from the east, but little else is known of him.

STATISTICS:

Speed Factor: 2
Proficiency Type: Katana
Type: One-handed

#### Naught Katana +5 (NWN2)

Once a sacred katana from the imperial court of Shou, the poor combination of an especially canny thief and an especially drowsy guard set this powerful artifact into the wilds along the great twisting Golden Way. It was formed from a slice of an unknown substance, cut from another plane, and forged in an act that drank its creator's soul away... and that the blade seems to be growing slowly more powerful - with a sinking hunger that is never satiated.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Each hit drains 1d4 Hit Points from the target and transfers them to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

THACO: +5

#### The Devoted Servant +1 (NWN2)

Created for the most loyal samurai of the Shogun, these katana hail from the far-off land of Wa - an island nation within Kara-Tur. How it managed to find its way to you is somewhat of a mystery, but its powers remain thankfully intact.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
- Armor Class: +1

### Long Swords

#### Intercession +1 (IWD)

This long sword was crafted for the well-traveled ranger Kelhanion of Soubar in 1272. Wearing light armor and no shield, Kelhanion wanted a weapon that would protect him in combat. Intercession was made for him by an acquaintance, the wizard Peth of Elturel. The weapon itself is rather mundane in appearance, which is exactly how Kelhanion wanted it to look. It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard. The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin. The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons. Intercession was lost with Kelhanion when he was slaughtered by over a dozen trolls in the Trollbark Forest.

#### Long Sword of Action +2 (IWD)

These swords are usually referred to as double-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. The blade of this sword is covered with all sorts of arcane symbols.

#### Turodahel +2 (IWD)

Crafted in 1021 DR for the warrior Makael the Lean, Turodahel has a bloody military history. Makael was a mercenary who sold his services to anyone with the right amount of coin. Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

### Maces

#### Petty's Tempest +2 (NWN2) 

The most recent recorded appearance of one of these weapons was in the black markets of Amn, rightfully commanding an impressive price. Several such maces have been found over time, each with an array of elemental spells and effects woven through them. The creator remains elusive, though the name "Petty" is evident on each example. It is possible he is a smith on Toril, but his obvious understanding of planar forces suggests a more traveled origin.

#### Soldier's Might +2 (NWN2)

It is said that lieutenants in the armies of Algarond were given these weapons, but not told of the flaws in their design. Many of the wielders died, but all fought valiantly and were accorded the honor of heroes of the realm. The generals responsible for these flawed weapons escaped punishment, and today they are remembered among the revered dead.

#### Chef Gronk's Tenderizer +2 (NWN2)

Cooking for pirates is a tough job - and it's pretty clear from this instrument that Chef Gronk wasn't just an ordinary Chef. While this hammer appears to have been primarily used for culinary purposes, you can't quite discern whether the bits of meat on it are the remains of the pirate band's most recent meal or their most recent battle.

### Morning Stars

#### Bone Phoenix +1 (NWN2)

These are the hallmark weapons of the fallen Lord Craghand of Unther, and are named for the fate he suffered. Lacking magical talent himself, Craghand employed a cadre of necromancers in an effort to extend his meager legacy. These wizards succeeded only in damning his court to an age of undeath. Now his mindless form stalks Faerun, his ageless skeletal body rising time and again even if destroyed.

#### Sleepwalker Kin +2 (NWN2)

These weapons were supposed to be a great breakthrough for the orcs of Amn. Clan leaders liked the idea of rendering enemies helpless, but after the efforts of many shamans and several imprisoned human wizards, the project was abandoned. It seemed that in the hands of the orc elite, a hit strong enough to activate the ability often killed the target anyway, and the extra cost was deemed redundant.

### Ninja-Tos

#### Courtesan Blade + 2 (NWN2)

Courtesan assassins were famous for using their wit and charm to infiltrate the intimate chambers of the enemy by the most disarming method imaginable: they were invited. The practice became infamous, which is likely why it is used so infrequently today.

STATISTICS:

#### Remembrance +3 (NWN2)

At the twilight of the Illefarn Empire, several elven archmages belonging to the Order of Fallen Leaves devised a plan to store their accumulated magical knowledge into a number of these staves. The plan never reached fruition and the Order was destroyed by orcs and all but one of the staves destroyed.

#### Staff of Balpheron +1 (NWN2) CURSED SORCERER/WIZARD ONLY

Legend holds this staff was created by the wizard Balpheron on the eve of his ascension to lichdom. Many believe Balpheron had already chosen his fate, and only wanted the staff to make himself more powerful as a lich. But others claiming it was the staff itself that led him down the dark path, as the creation of such a powerful item pushed the mage beyond his limits and destroyed what remained of his sanity.

### Scimitars

#### Laughing Blade +2 (NWN2)

It is doubtful the victim of a Laughing Blade finds anything humorous about it. These items were created by master illusionist Daniel Suther, who wanted an interesting twist in the hedge maze he built. Several automatons were equipped with the weapons and heroes accepting his challenge had to battle them, the maze, and their own senses. Suther was eventually jailed after several deaths on his estate.

 ### Short Swords

 #### Sloth +2 (IWD)

 The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. Inscriptions of power can be seen etched on the surface of the blade.

### Spears

#### Briarspike +2 (NWN2)

Briarspikes look like they could have been plucked from some giant quill-covered beast, but the methods involved are very sophisticated and bear the hallmarks of Menold of Waterdeep. This may shed some light on his fate, as he was reported lost to an orc raid on his tower years ago. He may have attempted to buy his freedom with his services, but it would have only made him more valuable as a prisoner.

This weapon was a gift from the elven nation to the kingdom of Algarond after the declaration of peace between the two peoples in 1065 DR. Spears of this type are carefully crafted, and rumored to come from the wood of Evereska itself.

### Two-Handed Swords

#### Blade of the Rashemi +3 (NWN2)

Like all greatswords from the Land of Berserkers, these weapons are massively built, and so durable that some have survived for thousands of years. These swords are notable for their effectiveness against spellcasters, and history records that the land's Witch rulers expelled all known copies out of fear of their abilities.

#### Kresselack's Sword +1 (IWD)

Kresselack, the barbarian king, once wielded this sword to aid him in his conquest of the northern lands. It is not known, however, how he originally acquired the weapon. Most scholars believe Kresselack simply found the weapon in one of his many conquests. However, rumors do persist that the sword was the creation of some powerful wizard and was commissioned by Kresselack himself. The truth of the matter will never be known.

Emanating a faint blue aura, this gigantic weapon is a serrated two-handed sword made of bone. It will occasionally strike with a shocking force of cold, chilling the victim to the bone.

#### The Golem's Blade +3 (NWN2)

Part of the process in creating a blade golem involves the crafting of a powerful magic sword to serve as one of the golem's "arms." Usually, the sword becomes a part of the golem, losing all enchantment if the golem is destroyed, but the exceptional power and craftsmanship of this particular sword allowed it to survive its golem's destruction.

#### Two-Handed Sword +1: Hammering (IWD)

The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.
