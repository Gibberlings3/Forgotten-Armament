## Melee Weapons

### Battle Axes

#### Axe of Dead Illusk +2
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#axe-of-dead-illusk-2)

A little-known section of ruined Illusk holds corpse after corpse from a barbarian invasion repelled ages ago. The clan is forgotten, but their surviving weapons seem to embody everything cruel and savage in warfare, and create fearful images in the minds of those who witness them.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Each hit drains 1 Hit Point from the target and transfer it to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

#### Battle Axe +2: Defender 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#battle-axe-2-defender)

Besides its superb craftsmanship, tiny runes of power can be seen etched all along the surface. It's obvious a lot of time and effort went into its creation, and although not apparent at first, a slight blue glow can be seen emanating from the runes.

STATISTICS:

#### Deepstone Progeny +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#deepstone-progeny-2)

Torgin of the Light was a respected and prolific slayer of undead, which made his eventual descent into vampirism all the more tragic. His still-living companions saw the change as an insult to the life he once cherished, and vowed to destroy his undead form. To this end they crafted the Deepstone Progeny, adapted from the weapon that had previously served Torgin so well. History does not record the outcome of the battle between Torgin and his friends, but their axes are found across Faerun.

STATISTICS:

### Bastard Swords

#### Bloodletter +4 - Non-Good Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#bloodletter-4---non-good-only)

Forged in smoldering brimstone fires and cooled in the blood of its creator, a Bloodletter blade is a typically evil weapon, the kind of sword that has inspired more than a little diabolical laughter while being waved in the face of one or another virtuous knight. It is possessed of thoroughly heinous life-stealing energies, but if the fates of its previous owners are any indication, its major characteristic could well be the attraction of "comeuppance."

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Inflicts 2 points of bleeding damage per hit (one point per round)
- Each hit drains 1 Hit Point from the target and transfers it to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

#### Discord +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#discord-2)

A line of black crystal runs the length of this blade, marking it the handiwork of Ortius of Gond, the Mad Tinker. Blades from his stock resonate unnaturally when struck, and although mortal ears can barely perceive the tone, they certainly suffer the effects well enough. The origin of the crystal is not clear, though Ortius was known to have bartered his services to planar creatures on occasion.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- 20% chance per hit of confusing the target for 1 round (Save vs. Spell negates)

(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#flaming-bastard-sword-1)

Besides its superb craftsmanship, tiny runes of power can be seen etched all along the surface. It's obvious a lot of time and effort went into its creation, and although not apparent at first, a slight blue glow can be seen emanating from the runes.

#### Nameless Light +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#nameless-light-2)

Legend states that the warrior Alesia brought the Nameless Light from the stars, although other tales claim it was forged by a grieving father, or was the weapon of a virtuous paladin. In truth, several such blades exist. They were created with the blessing of the Harpers, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.

STATISTICS:

### Daggers

#### Ice Talon +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#ice-talon-2)

Weapons of this type are technically impossible, since their blades are made of nothing but razor-sharp ice crystals. Most sages agree they are kept frozen by some sort of link to the inner planes, but this is ultimately just speculation. Ice Talon daggers show a jagged blade and may have been part of a single larger weapon at one time, though the force required to shatter the magic blade must have been enormous indeed.

#### Myr Styah'be'eh +4 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#myr-styahbeeh-4)

Scholars have long argued over the nature of this blade, claming it as a part of many ancient empires - Mulhorandi, Netherese, Imaskari - but its construction defies the conventions of any known civilization. One young wizard, promptly laughed into obscurity, once put forth an argument that the item was actually of kobold make, that its name - considered untranslatable by all others who had studied it - meant something like "master stabby" in an obscure dialect of that dimunitive people. The scholar's final argument was that as harmless as many consider kobold to be today, they do claim their lineage from dragons - and if this blade is any proof, a weapon does not have to look magnificent to be viciously effective.

### Flails

#### Crooked Flail +1 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#crooked-flail-1)

The flail is a sturdy wooden handle attached to an iron rod, a wooden rod with spikes, or a spiked iron ball. Between the handle and its implement is either a hinge or chain link. The weapon was originally used as a tool for threshing grain.

### Halberds

#### Cruel Halberd +3
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#cruel-halberd-3)

This halberd, permanently stained with the blood of its victims, was wielded by several generations of orc warlords, all who either took it up when the previous owner died in battle or was murdered by a rival. The halberd was lost in the final battle when the orcs were finally driven out of Illusk.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#will-of-atar-1)

These weapons bear the mark of Atar of the Flame, high shaman of a northern cult that fell under the influence of a creature from the plane of fire. What this entity received in exchange for creating such powerful items is unknown.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#dragonsblood-katana-2)

The katana is the pinnacle of the swordsmith's craft, combining grace and artful design with razor-edged efficiency.

#### Kaga-To +1 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#kaga-to-1)

If memory serves correctly, these weapons date to the stadium battles of old Kai Chen province, where promising warriors would test their skills against the greatest samurai of the day in ritual combat. If ever a challenger was victorious, he or she won the people's ovation and fame forever, symbolized by a Kaga-To katana. The blade is etched with a simple phrase: "Tell me how you fight, and I will tell you what you are."

#### Master Li's Way +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#master-lis-way-2)

Once thought a unique instance of the swordmaker's craft, several katanas of this type have now been linked to a ship that ran aground on the Sword Coast some years ago. All bear the markings of Master Hu Li, a great artificer from the east, but little else is known of him.

#### Naught Katana +5 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#naught-katana-5)

Once a sacred katana from the imperial court of Shou, the poor combination of an especially canny thief and an especially drowsy guard set this powerful artifact into the wilds along the great twisting Golden Way. It was formed from a slice of an unknown substance, cut from another plane, and forged in an act that drank its creator's soul away... and that the blade seems to be growing slowly more powerful - with a sinking hunger that is never satiated.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
- Each hit drains 1d4 Hit Points from the target and transfers them to the wielder. This will not heal beyond the wielder's maximum.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#the-devoted-servant-1)

Created for the most loyal samurai of the Shogun, these katana hail from the far-off land of Wa - an island nation within Kara-Tur. How it managed to find its way to you is somewhat of a mystery, but its powers remain thankfully intact.

#### Darksteel Long Sword +1
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#darksteel-long-sword-1)

Darksteel is silvery in hue when polished or cut, but its exposed surfaces have a deep, gleaming purple luster. This alloy of meteoric iron and steel is tempered with rare, magical oils to give the metal its uncanny abilities. Darksteel is commonly used in the crafting of magic items related to storms or lightning.

#### The Gladiator +1
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#the-gladiator-1)

Long ago, the formians built great subterranean cities and vast, cavernous empires. Societies of war, they reveled in the blood and glory of the gladiatorial pit, where slaves and prisoners fought for their cruel amusement. One such gladiator was the human Ajan, who stole the blade of his formian master and used it to escape to the surface with Zoe, his love. It is said that all who wield it are bound for greatness.

#### Intercession +1 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#intercession-1)

This long sword was crafted for the well-traveled ranger Kelhanion of Soubar in 1272. Wearing light armor and no shield, Kelhanion wanted a weapon that would protect him in combat. Intercession was made for him by an acquaintance, the wizard Peth of Elturel. The weapon itself is rather mundane in appearance, which is exactly how Kelhanion wanted it to look. It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard. The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin. The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons. Intercession was lost with Kelhanion when he was slaughtered by over a dozen trolls in the Trollbark Forest.

#### Long Sword of Action +2 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#long-sword-of-action-2)

These swords are usually referred to as double-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. The blade of this sword is covered with all sorts of arcane symbols.

#### Turodahel +2 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#turodahel-2)

Crafted in 1021 DR for the warrior Makael the Lean, Turodahel has a bloody military history. Makael was a mercenary who sold his services to anyone with the right amount of coin. Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

### Maces

#### Petty's Tempest +2 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#pettys-tempest-2) 

The most recent recorded appearance of one of these weapons was in the black markets of Amn, rightfully commanding an impressive price. Several such maces have been found over time, each with an array of elemental spells and effects woven through them. The creator remains elusive, though the name "Petty" is evident on each example. It is possible he is a smith on Toril, but his obvious understanding of planar forces suggests a more traveled origin.

It is said that lieutenants in the armies of Algarond were given these weapons, but not told of the flaws in their design. Many of the wielders died, but all fought valiantly and were accorded the honor of heroes of the realm. The generals responsible for these flawed weapons escaped punishment, and today they are remembered among the revered dead.

Cooking for pirates is a tough job - and it's pretty clear from this instrument that Chef Gronk wasn't just an ordinary Chef. While this hammer appears to have been primarily used for culinary purposes, you can't quite discern whether the bits of meat on it are the remains of the pirate band's most recent meal or their most recent battle.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#bone-phoenix-1)

These are the hallmark weapons of the fallen Lord Craghand of Unther, and are named for the fate he suffered. Lacking magical talent himself, Craghand employed a cadre of necromancers in an effort to extend his meager legacy. These wizards succeeded only in damning his court to an age of undeath. Now his mindless form stalks Faerun, his ageless skeletal body rising time and again even if destroyed.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#sleepwalker-kin-2)

These weapons were supposed to be a great breakthrough for the orcs of Amn. Clan leaders liked the idea of rendering enemies helpless, but after the efforts of many shamans and several imprisoned human wizards, the project was abandoned. It seemed that in the hands of the orc elite, a hit strong enough to activate the ability often killed the target anyway, and the extra cost was deemed redundant.

Courtesan assassins were famous for using their wit and charm to infiltrate the intimate chambers of the enemy by the most disarming method imaginable: they were invited. The practice became infamous, which is likely why it is used so infrequently today.

At the twilight of the Illefarn Empire, several elven archmages belonging to the Order of Fallen Leaves devised a plan to store their accumulated magical knowledge into a number of these staves. The plan never reached fruition and the Order was destroyed by orcs and all but one of the staves destroyed.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#staff-of-balpheron-1---sorcererwizard-only)

Legend holds this staff was created by the wizard Balpheron on the eve of his ascension to lichdom. Many believe Balpheron had already chosen his fate, and only wanted the staff to make himself more powerful as a lich. But others claiming it was the staff itself that led him down the dark path, as the creation of such a powerful item pushed the mage beyond his limits and destroyed what remained of his sanity.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#laughing-blade-2)

It is doubtful the victim of a Laughing Blade finds anything humorous about it. These items were created by master illusionist Daniel Suther, who wanted an interesting twist in the hedge maze he built. Several automatons were equipped with the weapons and heroes accepting his challenge had to battle them, the maze, and their own senses. Suther was eventually jailed after several deaths on his estate.

(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#sloth-2)

The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. Inscriptions of power can be seen etched on the surface of the blade.

Briarspikes look like they could have been plucked from some giant quill-covered beast, but the methods involved are very sophisticated and bear the hallmarks of Menold of Waterdeep. This may shed some light on his fate, as he was reported lost to an orc raid on his tower years ago. He may have attempted to buy his freedom with his services, but it would have only made him more valuable as a prisoner.

Like all greatswords from the Land of Berserkers, these weapons are massively built, and so durable that some have survived for thousands of years. These swords are notable for their effectiveness against spellcasters, and history records that the land's Witch rulers expelled all known copies out of fear of their abilities.

Kresselack, the barbarian king, once wielded this sword to aid him in his conquest of the northern lands. It is not known, however, how he originally acquired the weapon. Most scholars believe Kresselack simply found the weapon in one of his many conquests. However, rumors do persist that the sword was the creation of some powerful wizard and was commissioned by Kresselack himself. The truth of the matter will never be known.

Part of the process in creating a blade golem involves the crafting of a powerful magic sword to serve as one of the golem's "arms." Usually, the sword becomes a part of the golem, losing all enchantment if the golem is destroyed, but the exceptional power and craftsmanship of this particular sword allowed it to survive its golem's destruction.

#### Two-Handed Sword +1: Hammering 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#two-handed-sword-1-hammering)

The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations. This one is particularly good at its job as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.

(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#robe-of-enfusing)

Since the age of Netheril, mages have learned to bestow a wide variety of magical properties upon the everyday objects that surround them. A favorite item of such enchantment is the common robe. It is lightweight, affordable, and holds its enchantment well, thereby making it ideal equipment for a mage. Due to their magical heritage, however, only single-, dual-, and multi-class mages may wear these enchanted robes.

There are a small number of these valuable gold and crimson robes floating around the realms, and all of them are the creation of an abjurer named Delgam of the Many Hands—so called for his extensive use of the expression "on the other hand..." Delgam eschewed imbuing his items with offensive powers or other miscellaneous magic effects. Instead, he focused on what abjurers tend to focus on: defense. His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well-known legacy.

However, they are sized to fit both genders in the rare times when both male and female Rashemi spellcasters take to the field of battle, and pit their intense powers and determination against the might of their foes.

When he angered a rival enchanter, the wizard Mekhari came under repeated attack from his own charmed bodyguards. This was expensive as well as dangerous, so he set about trying to counter the threat in a way that would not mean constantly killing his own men. With armor of this type Mekhari considered his men above reproach. He was proven wrong when his own lieutenant murdered him in a dispute over back wages.

This gold-hued armor is supposedly made from the hide of a ferocious aurumvorax, a six-legged wolverine-like beast that devours not only meat, but also precious metals. The diet of the creature gives its hide a spectacular finish and incredible protective qualities, a resilience shared by armor constructed from it.

Halfling artificers are credited with creating the best-known modern examples of this heat resistant armor, having apparently constructed a number of suits to combat a marauding efreeti some 50 years ago. The design has since been copied, though the great expense involved and the highly specific focus of the finished item means that copies are rarely seen on the market.

#### Baleful Mail 
(Taken from IWD) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#baleful-mail)

This armor was crafted in 1221 DR by a duergar smith working for a vengeful priest of Bane named Alerri of West Waterdeep. During Alerri's early days in the priesthood, he frequently provoked and attacked agents of Sune. Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair's followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite's antics. Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#dorons-mistake)

Doron was a master dwarven smith, but even masters make mistakes. While disassembling a suit of "worthless elven chain" - for research, of course - he accidentally dropped several links into his forge, and that trace amount of mithral tainted everything he made until he could scour the thing from top to bottom. Each suit made during this time was infused with strange magic, but Doron threw them all on the trash heap, and was known to slap anyone he saw wearing one.

For those who pair the disciplines of steel and spell, this armor seems crafted to fit them, as they bridge the daylight realm of war and the nighttime realm of magic. And as this armor allows its user to cast freely, so does it protect them from being instantly slain by certain spells - promising that it will not allow them swift passage into the hands of death.

### Plate Mail Armors

#### Deep Guardian's Plate 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#deep-guardians-plate)

In an effort to better protect their soldiers, the artificers of ancient Imaskar set about creating a kind of living symbiote, something that would bond with their user and protect them from harm. Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten. When Imaskar fell, it is likely they crept back into the silent darkness they'd come from... or possibly changed into something else...

#### Armor of Gram the Mouse - Paladin Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#armor-of-gram-the-mouse---paladin-only)

At the age of eighteen, a small young man from Voonlar named Gram Chandler was inducted into the ranks of the Damaran paladins of Torm. Nicknamed "the Mouse" by his fellow classmates for his small size and great love of cheese, Gram had become well-respected during his time as an initiate. However, when it came time to arm and armor the initiates as full paladins of the church, the embarrassed order found that it did not possess a suit small enough to fit Gram. The priests and paladins apologized to Gram and told him they would get a suit of armor made as quickly as possible. Though Gram's classmates snickered about it, Gram smiled and quietly went about his business.

Only a month later, while most of the other paladins of the church were away on business, a lone wounded rider approached the Tormish fortress and demanded to see whoever was in charge. Gram was far from in charge, but there were no paladins of rank present. The rider turned out to be a Thayan escort for a female Red Wizard who had been attacked by bugbears in the wilderness. The priests sneered at the rider when they learned of his nationality, but Gram told the escort it was his duty to protect travelers from aggression within Tormish territory. The priests tried to dissuade Gram from attempting to go after the Red Wizard, but Gram rebuked them and repeated to the escort that it would be his honor to mount a rescue effort.

Protected only by his helmet and the heavy hide demanded by the climate, Gram followed the escort to the site of the battle. From there, the escort tracked the bugbears to a cave. When Gram and the escort entered, they immediately came under heavy attack from bugbears. The escort's resolve faded and he fled back into the wilderness. Gram pressed on, killing four bugbears and wounding two more before he died within sight of the Red Wizard. Though the bugbears were by no means wiped out, the attack weakened and confused them enough that the Red Wizard was able to blast her way out of the cave system.

Later, she returned to Damara and approached the priests of the wilderness temple of Torm from which Gram came. When she learned about the selfless valiance of Gram, even her Thay-hardened heart was moved. She had a suit of armor constructed and enchanted for her small savior. It was built to the finest standards of quality, and it is said that the priests and paladins of Torm assembled at Gram's burial gasped in awe at its beauty. In later years, Gram was used as an example of devotion to duty for fledgling paladins. His revered tomb was looted by a fractured orcish army from Vaasa when the temple was destroyed in 1298 DR.

Everyone said that the bard Ysridain's ability with a lute was exceptional, but a few maintained that it was something more, something supernatural. After Ysridain's death at the hands of a jilter lover, the people of Waterdeep learned just how true those rumors had been. Early in his career, Ysridain realized that his physical beauty was far greater than his talent with music. He was a gifted musician, but he knew he would never be legendary unless he had assistance. Ysridain contracted a wizard to summon forth a powerful demon so the bard could negotiate a pact with the forces of darkness. A succubus answered the call. She agreed to inspire Ysridain with creative forces beyond his understanding. In exchange, upon his death, all that had resulted from her inspiration and Ysridain's soul would be hers.

Ysridain thought on this for a short time and eventually agreed to the succubus' deal. The succubus occupied a pendant that Ysridain wore around his neck. It had the effect of inspiring the bard to great musical deeds, but it also created intense physical lust. When Ysridain died, the bard's soul was swapped into the amulet and the succubus was released into the world. If the amulet ever shatters, Ysridain's soul will be dragged straight to the lower planes. Until then, Ysridain's succubus roams Faerun searching for the children sired by the bard's lust.

Attempting to form an anti-thieves' guild, Ronger Delphos, a successful merchant, paid thieves to become security experts, to guard merchants in Waterdeep. The guards were trained to use wands with the Hold Person spell, to capture the thieves for interrogation. To counteract this security measure, magical belts were purchased by the thieves' guild, which nullified the effects of such spells. In the escalating war between the two guilds, many of these belts found their way into pawnshops and equipment stores.

This disease soon spread out of control, and far from curbing their numbers actually threatened their extinction. To maintain the balance, these same druids created a number of these ceremonial belts to ensure the survival of the clan's leaders. Ultimately the Uthgardt survived the plague, though the incident did not improve their opinion of outsiders.

#### Graena's Triumph - Barbarian Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#graenas-triumph---barbarian-only)

The famous barbarian explorer Graena was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of the Uthgardt northerners. When she tried to leave the tribe to seek her fortune in southern lands, the elders of the tribe told her she could not leave. At that time, only men were allowed to leave the tribe. The elders believed women were too valuable to let go. In order to prove herself to the elders, Graena had to run a gauntlet of the strongest warriors in the tribe and wrest the belt of the head warrior from his body. Graena underwent the challenge and emerged bloody and broken, but victorious. According to tribal law, she was now the head warrior of the tribe and effectively male. The elders knew she was going to leave, but they gave her a warrior's name, Graena Blood-Has-Dried. She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.

Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a belt constructed that looked identical to the belt she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment. Graena was wearing her belt when she died fighting a vampire and his undead minions in ancient Illefarn ruins.

Lathar was a wizard of little renown who thought himself worthy to test a powerful archmage in a magical duel. Knowing his rival's penchant for death magic, Lathar crafted this special belt to grant himself immunity against such wizardry.
The day of the duel came and the two wizards squared off against each other. The archmage flung nasty fingers of death and invoked powerful power word kills left and right and all the while Lathar laughed.

"Do your worst!" Lathar said, mocking his rival.

The archmage frowned. Then with a clever smile he snapped his fingers and summoned forth a dire bear which promptly swallowed poor Lathar in just one bite.

These ancient bracers were presumably found in the depths of the Sunken City. Their craftsmenship suggests an Imaskari origin and despite being clearly magical, they look badly worn through the passage of millenia. You cannot be sure whether their magic has faded as much as their appearance has.

### Cloaks

#### A Mad Gent's Cloak - Cleric Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#a-mad-gents-cloak---cleric-only)

In the not-so-distant history of Abeir-Toril, the deities of the world were cast out of their celestial and infernal homes by the High God, Ao. The gods were forced to inhabit the bodies of mortals and walk the face of Faerun. This was an aptly-named Time of Troubles for most people in the world. For Madachi Jhent of Waterdeep, it meant the end of his fortune, his family, and his sanity.

When the Time of Troubles ended, the goddess of wealth, Waukeen was unaccounted for. The priests of that deity refused to disburse any of the funds Waukeen's lay followers had entrusted to the church. Madachi Jhent, who was heavily in debt at the time and in the process of moving his remaining fortune around, lost almost all of his wealth. His aristocratic wife, disgusted at her husband's financial collapse, took their children and traveled to Baldur's Gate. Madachi Jhent was only able to salvage a cloak, a pair of boots, and a pair of gloves from the collectors who looted his home.

He later claimed that as he lay in the street outside his home, he saw a pattern in the black fabric of the cloak he clutched in his hands. It was not until many weeks later that he realized the pattern matched the pattern of the High God, Ao. He believed it was a sign that he was destined to call the faithful to the new church of Ao.

#### Antimagic Cloak 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#antimagic-cloak)

This plain-looking cloak is made from the fibers of plants specially cultivated during the Time of Troubles, and the weave of the cloak is woven counter to the magical Weave of Faerun. The result is that magic in its vicinity tends to fade and lose its power, making this a handy item to have when confronting mages.

#### Balhodrie's Constant Hearth - Thief Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#balhodries-constant-hearth---thief-only)

Balhoderie the Wrathful was a pirate captain in Nelanther in the mid-1300s DR. Though he was known for his great temper and brutality, he was rather sensitive when it came to physical discomfort from the elements. He was constantly commanding his underlings to add wood to his fires or open windows in his cabin. He was so annoyed by the inability of his crew to constantly maintain a perfect temperature around him that he hunted down a Stormlord of Talos and slew him for his cloak.

Though Balhoderie had some of his lady friends sew over the Talosian symbols on the cloak with bits of pirate flags, the brothers of the Stormlord never forgot Balhoderie's blasphemous plunder. By 1360, they had managed to install a youthful Stormlord on one of Balhoderie's three ships, the Sarketa. When the opportunity presented itself, the Stormlord roused the crew to mutiny. After Balhoderie had been overthrown, the Stormlord returned the cloak to the brotherhood and installed himself as the new commander of the dead pirate's fleet.

The Black Cloud Madion terrorized the southern Sword Coast for the next five years before he died in a bloody battle with heavily armed merchant ships just outside the port of Baldur's Gate.

This incredibly heavy cloak was a gift from Sister Calliana for saving the soul of the Voice of Durdel Anatha. It was originally worn by a penitent necromancer who was ashamed at how he had abused the souls of the dead. The cloak is dark gray and made of five layers of thick, heavy wool.

#### Mantle of Gram the Mouse - Paladin Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#mantle-of-gram-the-mouse---paladin-only)

In 926 DR, ranks of the fighting orders of Torm grew thin due to a number of factors. In the northern reaches of the Dalelands, there were few who upheld the principles of duty and honor. The small number of priests there had a small trickle of converts to the faith and even fewer paladin candidates. But, on his thirteenth birthday, a local boy named Gram Chandler was presented to the church of Torm in Voonlar with the hopes that he would join one of their fighting orders. At first, the priests dismissed the boy because they thought he could be no older than nine years old. To their shock, they learned that his size was simply dwarfish for his age.

The priests were hesitant to admit such a small boy into a fighting order, but the list of applicants was lean. They put his name in the ledger of boys bound for Damara for training. The recording priest noted, "Gram Chandler, blond boy, aged thirteen, small, likes cheese." The paladin who inducted Gram as an initiate gave him a green cloak to warm him on their long journey north. Gram promised, unbidden, to never lose it. Unknown to the skeptical paladin, the boy would wear the cloak for the rest of his life.

Originally crafted by the druids of the High Forest from bark shed by the oldest living oaks in the wood, these potent gloves give the wearer a supernatural attunement with the natural world around him. The ancient treant Turlang is said to bestow Elder Oak Gloves upon druids who perform a great service in protection of the High Forest.

#### Favor of Ilum Lura 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#favor-of-ilum-lura)

The city of Nivian in ancient Illefarn observed an annual custom in which the six districts of the city vied for possession of the statue of a local hero. The tradition dictated that each of the districts participate in a non-lethal grand melee. The last combatant standing claimed the prize for his or her district. Since civic chaos was not the desired effect, each district had a champion that fought for its citizens. Though not required, champions often enjoyed a large morale boost when they had the patronage of a noble family.

In -1239 DR, the champion of the Artisan's District was a man named Beloran. Beloran was a man seemingly possessed by his desire to win the championship for his district. He had tried to do so for six years and failed each time. Unbeknownst to the citizens of the city, Beloran's sole motivation for participating in the melee was to earn the favor of the emperor's niece. The beautiful woman, Ilum Lura, had always politely rejected Beloran's advances. After six years of misplaced civic pride, Ilum's father commanded his daughter to give Beloran a token of her favor. She reluctantly did so, giving him a pair of riding gloves that he wore pinned to the shoulder of his sword arm. To the surprise of everyone outside the family, Beloran fought more ferociously than he ever had before. He won the statue for the Artisan's District. As custom dictated, this also meant that he was to receive a kiss from the lady whose favor he had worn into battle. Ilum gave Beloran his kiss and immediately retreated to her family estate.

In the following months, an inflamed and confused Beloran tried in vain to kindle a relationship with the elusive Ilum. She eventually agreed to meet with him, but only told him that her heart belonged to another. Deranged with grief at this revelation, Beloran journeyed into the deepest forests of Illefarn and was never heard from again. Those who saw him leave Nivian said that he was still wearing Ilum's favor upon his shoulder.

#### Ysridain's Touch - Bard Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#ysridains-touch---bard-only)

Besides his prized lute, the seductive half-elven minstrel Ysridain's most valued possessions were his hands. During one of his most famous affairs, Ysridain managed to seduce one of the most powerful wizards in old Waterdeep. This wizard, Crestana, cherished Ysridain's company so much that she crafted anything he wanted at the slightest suggestion. The product of one such request was a pair of fine, thin gloves that protected Ysridain's hands and made him even more charming.

Though few believe that Ysridain needed the help, he accepted the gloves happily. Unfortunately for the wandering bard, Crestana had also imbued the gloves with a power that made it more difficult for him to lie. When Ysridain began an affair with a few other Waterdhavian ladies, Crestana quickly caught wind of it. Caught leaving the home of one lady, Ysridain tried to talk his way out of the situation. Due to her enchantments, Crestana quickly saw through Ysridain's lies. Crestana unleashed her full magical force on the bard in a public park. It was the end of him. Though local authorities understood Crestana's motivation, they had to make an example of her. They banished her from Waterdeep and she was never heard from again.

### Helmets

#### Anagrys' Mindmaze - Wizard/Sorcerer Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#anagrys-mindmaze---wizardsorcerer-only)

Anagrys Brightbrass was a talented gold dwarf wizard who hailed from the Great Rift, far to the south of Neverwinter. Although the folk of the North might be surprised by the idea of a dwarven wizard, the gold dwarves lack the suspicion of magic commonly held by shield dwarves. From an early age, Anagrys showed an aptitude for magic, and when she came of age at 50, her family enrolled her in the Academy Arcane deep within the Rift.

Anagrys studied sorcery under the tutelage of the archmage Randak Forn, a former adventurer who had spent much of his life making war on the aberrations that dwelt around the Great Rift. When Anagrys completed her studies, her teacher gave her this helmet, which he had worn while adventuring in the Underdark. Randak hoped to encourage his pupil to take up his crusade where he himself had left off; Anagrys did not disappoint him.

Creatures that attack the mind are the stuff of nightmares, so it is not surprising that items protecting against them might acquire some of their disrepute. Golden Circlets, for example, have been linked to a claim that when the drow first retreated underground they fed on intellect devourers, and that eating such a creature without wearing a circlet produced a mind flayer. This is all, of course, nothing more than superstitious tavern talk.

#### Helm of Gram the Mouse - Paladin Only 
(Taken from NWN2) - [Item Location](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/Forgotten-Armament/blob/main/ITEM-LOCATIONS.md#helm-of-gram-the-mouse---paladin-only)

Three years into his paladin training deep in the frozen land of Damara, the sixteen year-old Gram "the Mouse" found himself part of a patrol that was scouring the countryside for lost pilgrims that may have been slain by marauding orcish invaders. He had earned his nickname due to his small size and his insatiable appetite for cheese. Unfortunately, this epithet also biased many of the other candidates against him. He was not trusted with serious tasks, certainly not ones that required martial prowess.

To ensure that pilgrims were able to see their caravan, the group carried a bright green banner bearing the symbol of Torm on each side. When the caravan came under attack from orcs, the paladin leader shouted a command to Gram not to let the flag fall under any circumstances. Gram grabbed the flag and, moments later, the paladin who commanded him was shot dead by orcs. The other initiates charged forward toward the orcs and told Gram to get down, to find some cover. Gram refused, standing tall as arrows sailed around him. Inevitably, one of the orcish arrows hit Gram in the side of the head. He continued to remain upright, though the slow loss of blood eventually caused his footing to give way. The initiates believed Gram was dead, and returned to the temple for reinforcements.

Pilgrims found the caravan an hour later, long after the orcs had retreated from their positions. Gram was mostly frozen, upright but unconscious, still clutching the tilted flagstaff in his hands. When the Tormish paladins brought Gram back to the temple, his fellow candidates were chastised for abandoning him. Gram was given a heavy plate helmet to protect his head in future encounters.
