It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard. The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin. The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons.

It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

@12905 = ~At the age of eighteen, a small young man from Voonlar named Gram Chandler was inducted into the ranks of the Damaran paladins of Torm. Nicknamed "the Mouse" by his fellow classmates for his small size and great love of cheese, Gram had become well-respected during his time as an initiate. However, when it came time to arm and armor the initiates as full paladins of the church, the embarrassed order found that it did not possess a suit small enough to fit Gram. The priests and paladins apologized to Gram and told him they would get a suit of armor made as quickly as possible. Though Gram's classmates snickered about it, Gram smiled and quietly went about his business.

Only a month later, while most of the other paladins of the church were away on business, a lone wounded rider approached the Tormish fortress and demanded to see whoever was in charge. Gram was far from in charge, but there were no paladins of rank present. The rider turned out to be a Thayan escort for a female Red Wizard who had been attacked by bugbears in the wilderness. The priests sneered at the rider when they learned of his nationality, but Gram told the escort it was his duty to protect travelers from aggression within Tormish territory. The priests tried to dissuade Gram from attempting to go after the Red Wizard, but Gram rebuked them and repeated to the escort that it would be his honor to mount a rescue effort.

Protected only by his helmet and the heavy hide demanded by the climate, Gram followed the escort to the site of the battle. From there, the escort tracked the bugbears to a cave. When Gram and the escort entered, they immediately came under heavy attack from bugbears. The escort's resolve faded and he fled back into the wilderness. Gram pressed on, killing four bugbears and wounding two more before he died within sight of the Red Wizard. Though the bugbears were by no means wiped out, the attack weakened and confused them enough that the Red Wizard was able to blast her way out of the cave system.

Later, she returned to Damara and approached the priests of the wilderness temple of Torm from which Gram came. When she learned about the selfless valiance of Gram, even her Thay-hardened heart was moved. She had a suit of armor constructed and enchanted for her small savior. It was built to the finest standards of quality, and it is said that the priests and paladins of Torm assembled at Gram's burial gasped in awe at its beauty. In later years, Gram was used as an example of devotion to duty for fledgling paladins. His revered tomb was looted by a fractured orcish army from Vaasa when the temple was destroyed in 1298 DR.

Early in his career, Ysridain realized that his physical beauty was far greater than his talent with music. He was a gifted musician, but he knew he would never be legendary unless he had assistance. Ysridain contracted a wizard to summon forth a powerful demon so the bard could negotiate a pact with the forces of darkness. A succubus answered the call. She agreed to inspire Ysridain with creative forces beyond his understanding. In exchange, upon his death, all that had resulted from her inspiration and Ysridain's soul would be hers.

Ysridain thought on this for a short time and eventually agreed to the succubus' deal. The succubus occupied a pendant that Ysridain wore around his neck. It had the effect of inspiring the bard to great musical deeds, but it also created intense physical lust. When Ysridain died, the bard's soul was swapped into the amulet and the succubus was released into the world. If the amulet ever shatters, Ysridain's soul will be dragged straight to the lower planes. Until then, Ysridain's succubus roams Faerun searching for the children sired by the bard's lust.

@13705 = ~In 926 DR, ranks of the fighting orders of Torm grew thin due to a number of factors. In the northern reaches of the Dalelands, there were few who upheld the principles of duty and honor. The small number of priests there had a small trickle of converts to the faith and even fewer paladin candidates. But, on his thirteenth birthday, a local boy named Gram Chandler was presented to the church of Torm in Voonlar with the hopes that he would join one of their fighting orders. At first, the priests dismissed the boy because they thought he could be no older than nine years old. To their shock, they learned that his size was simply dwarfish for his age.

The priests were hesitant to admit such a small boy into a fighting order, but the list of applicants was lean. They put his name in the ledger of boys bound for Damara for training. The recording priest noted, "Gram Chandler, blond boy, aged thirteen, small, likes cheese." The paladin who inducted Gram as an initiate gave him a green cloak to warm him on their long journey north. Gram promised, unbidden, to never lose it. Unknown to the skeptical paladin, the boy would wear the cloak for the rest of his life.

@13707 = ~Balhoderie the Wrathful was a pirate captain in Nelanther in the mid-1300s DR. Though he was known for his great temper and brutality, he was rather sensitive when it came to physical discomfort from the elements. He was constantly commanding his underlings to add wood to his fires or open windows in his cabin. He was so annoyed by the inability of his crew to constantly maintain a perfect temperature around him that he hunted down a Stormlord of Talos and slew him for his cloak.

Though Balhoderie had some of his lady friends sew over the Talosian symbols on the cloak with bits of pirate flags, the brothers of the Stormlord never forgot Balhoderie's blasphemous plunder. By 1360, they had managed to install a youthful Stormlord on one of Balhoderie's three ships, the Sarketa. When the opportunity presented itself, the Stormlord roused the crew to mutiny. After Balhoderie had been overthrown, the Stormlord returned the cloak to the brotherhood and installed himself as the new commander of the dead pirate's fleet.

The Black Cloud Madion terrorized the southern Sword Coast for the next five years before he died in a bloody battle with heavily armed merchant ships just outside the port of Baldur's Gate.

The gods were forced to inhabit the bodies of mortals and walk the face of Faerun. This was an aptly-named Time of Troubles for most people in the world. For Madachi Jhent of Waterdeep, it meant the end of his fortune, his family, and his sanity.

When the Time of Troubles ended, the goddess of wealth, Waukeen was unaccounted for. The priests of that deity refused to disburse any of the funds Waukeen's lay followers had entrusted to the church. Madachi Jhent, who was heavily in debt at the time and in the process of moving his remaining fortune around, lost almost all of his wealth. His aristocratic wife, disgusted at her husband's financial collapse, took their children and traveled to Baldur's Gate. Madachi Jhent was only able to salvage a cloak, a pair of boots, and a pair of gloves from the collectors who looted his home.

He later claimed that as he lay in the street outside his home, he saw a pattern in the black fabric of the cloak he clutched in his hands. It was not until many weeks later that he realized the pattern matched the pattern of the High God, Ao. He believed it was a sign that he was destined to call the faithful to the new church of Ao.

Unfortunately for the wandering bard, Crestana had also imbued the gloves with a power that made it more difficult for him to lie. When Ysridain began an affair with a few other Waterdhavian ladies, Crestana quickly caught wind of it. Caught leaving the home of one lady, Ysridain tried to talk his way out of the situation.

@13807 = ~The city of Nivian in ancient Illefarn observed an annual custom in which the six districts of the city vied for possession of the statue of a local hero. The tradition dictated that each of the districts participate in a non-lethal grand melee. The last combatant standing claimed the prize for his or her district. Since civic chaos was not the desired effect, each district had a champion that fought for its citizens. Though not required, champions often enjoyed a large morale boost when they had the patronage of a noble family.

In -1239 DR, the champion of the Artisan's District was a man named Beloran. Beloran was a man seemingly possessed by his desire to win the championship for his district. He had tried to do so for six years and failed each time. Unbeknownst to the citizens of the city, Beloran's sole motivation for participating in the melee was to earn the favor of the emperor's niece. The beautiful woman, Ilum Lura, had always politely rejected Beloran's advances. After six years of misplaced civic pride, Ilum's father commanded his daughter to give Beloran a token of her favor. She reluctantly did so, giving him a pair of riding gloves that he wore pinned to the shoulder of his sword arm. To the surprise of everyone outside the family, Beloran fought more ferociously than he ever had before. He won the statue for the Artisan's District. As custom dictated, this also meant that he was to receive a kiss from the lady whose favor he had worn into battle. Ilum gave Beloran his kiss and immediately retreated to her family estate.

In the following months, an inflamed and confused Beloran tried in vain to kindle a relationship with the elusive Ilum. She eventually agreed to meet with him, but only told him that her heart belonged to another. Deranged with grief at this revelation, Beloran journeyed into the deepest forests of Illefarn and was never heard from again. Those who saw him leave Nivian said that he was still wearing Ilum's favor upon his shoulder.

He had earned his nickname due to his small size and his insatiable appetite for cheese. Unfortunately, this epithet also biased many of the other candidates against him. He was not trusted with serious tasks, certainly not ones that required martial prowess.

To ensure that pilgrims were able to see their caravan, the group carried a bright green banner bearing the symbol of Torm on each side. When the caravan came under attack from orcs, the paladin leader shouted a command to Gram not to let the flag fall under any circumstances. Gram grabbed the flag and, moments later, the paladin who commanded him was shot dead by orcs. The other initiates charged forward toward the orcs and told Gram to get down, to find some cover. Gram refused, standing tall as arrows sailed around him. Inevitably, one of the orcish arrows hit Gram in the side of the head. He continued to remain upright, though the slow loss of blood eventually caused his footing to give way. The initiates believed Gram was dead, and returned to the temple for reinforcements.

Pilgrims found the caravan an hour later, long after the orcs had retreated from their positions. Gram was mostly frozen, upright but unconscious, still clutching the tilted flagstaff in his hands. When the Tormish paladins brought Gram back to the temple, his fellow candidates were chastised for abandoning him. Gram was given a heavy plate helmet to protect his head in future encounters.
